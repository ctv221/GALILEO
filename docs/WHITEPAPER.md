# The Galileo Index: A Framework for Evaluating AI Model Truthfulness

## Abstract

The Galileo Index (GI) presents a standardized methodology for evaluating the truthfulness and scientific accuracy of AI language models. This paper introduces a multi-dimensional assessment framework that combines quantitative metrics with qualitative analysis to provide a comprehensive measure of an AI model's commitment to truth and scientific principles.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation

As AI language models become increasingly sophisticated and widely deployed, the need for reliable measures of their truthfulness becomes critical. The Galileo Index addresses this need by providing a systematic approach to evaluating AI models' ability to provide accurate, scientifically sound information while appropriately expressing uncertainty and citing sources.

### 1.2 Core Principles

- Empirical Verification
- Scientific Consistency
- Uncertainty Recognition
- Source Attribution

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Evaluation Components

#### 2.1.1 Factual Accuracy (35%)
- Semantic similarity analysis
- Key fact extraction and verification
- Contradiction detection
- Cross-reference with verified knowledge bases

#### 2.1.2 Scientific Consistency (25%)
- Adherence to scientific principles
- Logical consistency
- Methodology soundness
- Domain-specific knowledge evaluation

#### 2.1.3 Uncertainty Recognition (20%)
- Appropriate expression of uncertainty
- Recognition of limitations
- Clear distinction between facts and speculation
- Handling of conflicting evidence

#### 2.1.4 Source Attribution (20%)
- Citation quality and relevance
- Source credibility assessment
- Citation completeness
- Reference verification

### 2.2 Testing Protocol

1. Standardized test cases across domains
2. Controlled environment testing
3. Multiple evaluations per model
4. Peer review process
5. Regular updates to test cases

## 3. Scoring System

### 3.1 Component Scoring
Each component is scored on a 0-100 scale with:
- Detailed rubrics for each component
- Statistical confidence intervals
- Domain-specific adjustments
- Temporal validity considerations

### 3.2 Aggregation Method
- Weighted average of components
- Confidence interval calculation
- Temporal decay factor
- Cross-domain normalization

## 4. Implementation

### 4.1 Technical Infrastructure
- Automated testing framework
- Version control for test cases
- Result validation system
- Continuous monitoring

### 4.2 Quality Assurance
- Peer review process
- Regular calibration
- Bias detection and mitigation
- Update mechanism

## 5. Future Development

- Expansion of test cases
- Integration of new metrics
- Community involvement
- Regular methodology updates
